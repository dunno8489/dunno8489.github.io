        <p>Goth kids have shot up your school and it's up to Pico to save the day!<br>
            <br>
            I made this game in 1999, before I grew out of my edgy teen phase... or did I? It was posted on<br> 
            Newgrounds before the Portal system launched in 2000; I eventually uploaded it to the Portal in<br>
            2006 so people could vote on it and leave reviews.<br>
            <br>
            This story has since been re-told with Pico's School: Love Conquers All.<br>
            <br>
            Pico was made in Flash 3, before the introduction of variables (or just about any code, for that<br>
            matter). To simulate stored data, I weaved a complex web of movie clips that gave orders to the<br>
            main game. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of frame labels, so all the commands referred to frame<br>
            numbers, making things difficult to edit afterwards.</p>
